# Real-world-Data-Wrangling
data analyst nanodegree project 2:  Real-world Data Wrangling

In this research we took a group of students and group of employees and combine them together to find if:

- Does the remote work/study arrangement affect the likelihood of using counseling services?

- Does having a family history of mental health issues impact the use of counseling services?

- Is there a difference in social support levels between students and employees?
